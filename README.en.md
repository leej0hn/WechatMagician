# WechatMagician

WechatMagician is a fancy Xposed module designed for Chinese social media application Wechat, to help the users get the ultimate control of their messages and moments. It is based on the __[WechatSpellbook](https://github.com/Gh0u1L5/WechatSpellbook)__ framework. Currently this module supports WeChat 6.5.3+.

## Design
After learning from the failure of other Wechat modules, this project wants to do a better job in the following aspects:
* __Stability__: Most of those modules crashes for every Wechat update due to the obfuscator used by Wechat.
  - This project wraps each feature into a small "unit"; a single unit can crash safely without ruining the whole module.
  - This project has [a set of APIs](https://github.com/Gh0u1L5/WechatSpellbook/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/com/gh0u1l5/wechatmagician/spellbook/util/ReflectionUtil.kt) to analyze and match the signatures of critical classes / methods.
  - This project picks only [the signatures](https://github.com/Gh0u1L5/WechatSpellbook/tree/master/src/main/kotlin/com/gh0u1l5/wechatmagician/spellbook/mirror/) that exist since Wechat 6.5.3. Even if a signature is broken in the coming Wechat updates, it can be fixed easily.
  - This project hooks the methods close to system components / platform tools. This sacrifices some speed but ensures some stable break points.
* __Simplicity__: Large modules like WeXposed have many functions that are hardly used by most of the users, but most of the crashes are caused by those functions.
  - If those functions are implemented by different modules, and the users can just install the modules as they need, then our lives would be much more easier.
  - This project aims to "help the users get the ultimate control of their messages and moments"; more specifically, it wants to help the users to prevent recalling / deleting, retransmit messages, retweet moments, etc.
  - However, in the meantime, this project is also __an open-source template for Wechat modules__. With current framework you can easily hook several critical operations in Wechat including UI updates, XML parsing, file I/O, encryption/decryption engine and database operations.
  - If you have developed something that is unrelated to current purpose of this project, you may still get a standalone branch for your contribution.
* __Open Source__: Closed-source will only ruin a non-profit project and its developer.
  - This project will stay open-source, everyone is more than welcome to submit pull requests. Just don't submit codes for illegal purpose.
  - If the Wechat team formally states that a specific feature has been misused for illegal purpose, it will be removed immediately.
